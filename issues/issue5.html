    <h1>Issue #5 – terry</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>where do i even start with this one, Terry really thought he the right to bully for enjoyment. can you see a reocurring theme with the popular boys? However this one came for me instead of my friend, for almost 3 years i was a helpless victim but now i have him on a leash. The teachers are with me completly so if he even trys something he'll be out the door, he knows this because i have had another bully suspended for 2 weeks, his story will be not far away. Terry realy thought because he could play football and had big tough friends that he could use me as his play thing he was soo wrong, watch your step Terry i have alot more dirt on you than you know.  </p>
