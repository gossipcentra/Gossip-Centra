    <h1>Issue #4 – tara</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>i switched up the name for this one because she knows me but here we are. where do i even start with tara while unlike nosam form issue 3 i am friends in quotes with her. the reason its in quotes is because she is so fake, i'll give some examples so you know what i mean. first of all she is so rude and gives 0 shits about everyone else... in class she has made one of my many friends cry twice out of pure meaness, my friend is shy but tara for whatever reason thinks that is a good enough reason to yell at them and get them upset. a second example of tara being a bitch is also from my class, she constantly falls behind in group work because shes too busy hitting her strawberry penis flavour 2001 vape then she has the audacity to try and pass off her group as falling behind as their fault when its her who is dragging them behind. even after all of this she still takes it upon herself to try and get involved with me and my friends an expects us to welcome her with open arms. she wont read this, or if she does she wont know its about her... but by some miracle if she puts 2 and 2 together. hi girl, back off  </p>
    <p>XOXO gosip girl.</p>
