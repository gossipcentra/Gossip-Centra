    <h1>Issue #6 – ms leopard</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>This time im talking about a teacher, ms leopard is a choice subject teacher and coincidentally is the only class me and my friend have together. Ms leopard is a raging bitch, she always seperates us and is always so fake to our faces, she was over here saying i should have a grade A target blah blah and then when i told her i just wanted to pass she started screeching that im not bothered and should be trying harder. Ms leopard keeps her life very under wraps probablly because shes 50 and never been married although im not suprised, who would want to marry her. Anyway i know she'll let something slip soon but right now she can just stay as the butt of our jokes.  </p>
    <p>XOXO gossip girl. </p>
